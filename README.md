# COVID-19 Data Visualisation Project

This project explores global COVID-19 trends using confirmed case counts,
death counts, and vaccination rollout data. The goal of the project was to
design clear and interactive visualisations that help users understand how
COVID-19 evolved over time across different countries.

The project was completed as part of a team assignment for the
Data Visualisation module.

## Project Focus

The original project scope aimed to include a wider range of lifestyle and
mental health indicators (such as physical activity, social media usage, and
mental health data). However, due to inconsistent global coverage, missing
years, and unreliable reporting across many countries, the final scope was
refined.

The final project focuses on:
- Confirmed COVID-19 cases
- COVID-19 related deaths
- Vaccination rollout over time

This decision ensured accurate comparisons and avoided misleading results.

## Data Source

- **Our World in Data – COVID-19 Dataset**  
  https://ourworldindata.org/covid-19  

The dataset provides global, country-level COVID-19 data including cases,
deaths, and vaccination statistics.

## Repository Contents

- `covid_visualisation.ipynb`  
  Google Colab notebook containing data cleaning, aggregation, and
  visualisation code.

- `covid_cleaned.csv`  
  Cleaned dataset used for generating the final visualisations.

- `GROUPPROJECTREP.docx`  
  Project report describing the planning, execution, and outcomes of the
  project.

## Visualisations

The project includes interactive visualisations such as:
- Animated world maps showing monthly confirmed COVID-19 cases
- Time-based visualisations illustrating vaccination rollout
- Comparative charts highlighting trends across countries and time periods

These visualisations were designed to prioritise clarity, readability, and
ease of exploration.

## Notes

This repository reflects the final state of the project as submitted.
All analysis and visualisations were produced using publicly available data
and open-source tools.
